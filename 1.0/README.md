Hey! Hey!
Thank you for installing my software.
Here are some tips to make the most of it.
1) Check that the export folder exists!
2) Make sure you have the latest version of the software
3) Check that JGeckoU is correctly installed.
4) The file you obtain in the export must absolutely be placed in the "code" folder of JGeckoU. Because the software creates a file that JGeckoU can read.
5) When you select "MarioKart8", the file containing the codes is reset. Same for the others.
6) If you have any questions or codes to propose to me, here is my discord code: vcoding#4488.
7) Read the readme file carefully:)
8) Enjoy!

**WARNING**
Please run "launcher.py" in a terminal.
