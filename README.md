# CodeU

CodeU is a software created by vincent-coding. It is developed in Python. It allows you to retrieve some cheat code for WiiU games. It is advisable to use JGeckoU, because the file that CodeU generates is recognized by JGeckoU if it is placed in the "code" folder.<br />
<br />

You can now select the game you want to retrieve the cheat code. Clicking on your games will remove the contents of the file designed for the game (available in the "export" folder). Then all you have to do is click on the cheat codes and it will generate your file.<br/>
